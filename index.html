    <h4>When you're a college student who moves out of their childhood home, you're going to have some questions. The process can be difficult at times. Here are some things I've learned along the way.</H4>
<ul>
  <li>You're going to have to make a budget.</li>
  <li>You need to learn to do some basic cooking, if you don’t know how to already.</li>
  <li>Laundry is not always an easy thing. Often, city apartments don’t have in-unit laundry, so you’re going to have to figure out a way to get your laundry done. </li>
</ul>
